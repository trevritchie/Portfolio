[![LinkedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/-LinkedIn-0072b1?style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white)](https://linkedin.com/in/trevritchie/)

I am a cybersecurity graduate (M.S. May 2026) with a strong foundation in computer science and hands-on experience in threat management and incident response. My background includes a B.S. in Computer Science, a security internship with a critical infrastructure utility, and success in multiple CTF competitions.

## Objective

I am eager to apply my academic background and practical skills to a Tier 1 SOC Analyst role (or similar). My goal is to contribute to a SOC, learn from experienced professionals, and ultimately grow into Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) specialist.

## Projects

### InfoSec
- [ICS Attack Simulation, Forensic Analysis, and Incident Response Playbook for an Electrical Distribution Substation](https://github.com/trevritchie/ICS-Attack-Simulation-Forensic-Analysis-and-Incident-Response-Playbook)
	- Multi-stage ICS cyberattack simulation against 69kV/13.8kV distribution substation: IT-to-OT pivot culminating in unauthorized Modbus PLC  manipulation. Includes PCAP forensic analysis, NIST incident response playbook, attack scripts, and real-world impact assessment for critical infrastructure security education.
	- GNS3, Purdue Model for ICS Networks, VMWare Workstation Pro, Wireshark, Networking
- [Threat Modeling a Ransomware Attack on a Wallpaper Manufacturer](Threat_Modeling_a_Ransomware_Attack_on_a_Wallpaper_Manufacturer.pdf)
    - IEEE Style Paper, MITRE ATT&CK, Data Centric Threat Modeling
- [Digital Forensics on Compromised Windows Server 2022](Compromised_WindowsServer2022_Forensics.pdf)
	- Autopsy, FTK Imager, Windows Event IDs, Plaso, Ransomware

### Software
- [CreativePython](https://pypi.org/project/CreativePython): A Python package for audio-visual creative programming and algorithmic art. Available on PyPI and formal paper coming soon. Created for the AI, Music, and Interaction Lab at the College of Charleston.
- [Software Engineering Capstone with Zitles](https://zitles.com/): Wrote JavaScript to webscrape county websites for property titles, deeds, and tax records. Completed 3 new counties, expanding the startup's reach by 75%.
- [Movements, Not Chords](https://github.com/trevritchie/Movements-Not-Chords-JythonMusic): A smartphone instrument that maps physical movements to harmonies using accelerometer data.
- [JazzFlow](https://github.com/trevritchie/JazzFlow): A compositional aid that transforms a MIDI input into 32 inspiring variations.
- [Timbre!](https://github.com/trevritchie/Timbre): An audiovisual simulation where L-system tree growth generates music in real-time. Tree growth directly controls pitch, rhythm, dynamics, and panning.
- [GuitarDice](https://trevritchie.github.io/Guitar-Dice/): A web-based practice tool for guitarists to randomly explore chord voicings.
- [flac2aac](https://github.com/trevritchie/flac2aac): Batch convert FLAC files to AAC (m4a). Save a bunch of space while maintaining transparent audio quality. Retains file tags and album covers. I don't trust these online converters and they have low limits.

## Competitions
